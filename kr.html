                    VISION STRIKERS DOMINANCE
                </h2>
                <br><br>
                <p class="text_font">
                    Before I begin talking about why I think Korean Valorant is shaky right now, let me say this: I've been watching Korean Valorant since VCT Stage 1, I've seen the Vision Strikers dominance, I've seen teams come and go and I saw NUTURN dethrone VS when it mattered most. So I think I'm qualified to talk about the current situation in this region from a viewer's standpoint.
                    <br><br>
                    Alright let's do this, first:
                    <br><br>        
                    There are 3 things that are obvious about Korean Valorant:
                    <br><br>
                    1. The popularity of an eSport in Korea is directly correlated with how popular the actual game is in PC Bangs, and even though Valorant has made it into the Top 10 most played games in Korean PC Bangs several times, it has never been able to gain a consistent spot like Overwatch or PUBG.
                    <br><br>
                    2. The whole region is not economically stable, most of the viewership is from foreign viewers, teams are constantly disbanding and there aren't many orgs investing in Korean Valorant right now.
                    <br><br>
                    3. Korea has massive amounts of players who don't have a team and have been free agents. This means players who could join teams and challenge for success are basically turning into wasted talents.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2 class="subtitle_text_font">
                    SCENE
                </h2>
                <br><br>
                <p class="text_font">
                    Now let's see how this has affected the scene:
                    <br><br>
                    1. After the Riot ruling that prevented C9 and T1 from having teams in a different region, two really good teams became orgless, the effects of which are still seen today. Some of the talent went to other regions (Munchkin & Baazi went to Japan, xeta & Autumn came to C9 Blue), some of the talent went to ZF Gaming which also disbanded shortly after, and the rest became BearClaw Gaming, which surprise surprise also disbanded because of the economical instability.
                    <br><br>
                    BearClaw's team competed in Masters 1 as an orgless team (Team MUYAHO), and due to their performance they got signed by a new org (Rio Company, which also disbanded about a month ago.
                    <br><br>
                    This amount of volatility is normal in new eSports, but the volatility that Korea has is so much worse than NA, EU or even Brazil which have gotten most of the attention both from viewers and from Riot.
                    <br><br>
                    The situation is just disheartening to see, and it's not apparent anywhere more than Korea's circuit point standings. (3 teams with points have fully exited Valorant)
                    <br><br>
                    2. All of this volatility means that the scene has been progressively getting more and more one sided, which has never been more apparent than the upcoming Stage 3 Korean Challengers, where a total of 31 teams are competing (not even 32 T-T) and only 7 of them are established teams:
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, the Korean scene is basically this:
                    <br><br>
                    Good teams: Vision Strikers, NUTURN Gaming, DWG Kia
                    <br><br>
                    OK teams: Prince, TNL, GOMA, WGS
                    <br><br>
                    The rest: Good players who desperately need orgs, making orgless teams in the hopes of being signed due to their performance
                    <br><br>
                    3. Korea's tournament format is garbage, I'm talking pure trash. Here are the flaws:
                    <br><br>
                    - No Double eliminations in the Main Event, here's a thread from a while ago discussing the issues that it causes.
                    <br><br>
                    - Korea is treated as a lower level region, getting only one slot at Reykjavik, 2 at Berlin and then 1 again at Champions (With a second possible slot at the Last Chance Qualifiers).
                    <br><br>
                    This is STUPID, it really really is. I'm fine with EU and NA getting more slots, those are the main regions with the best teams and players and they deserve them. BUT WHY THE FUCK DOES KOREA HAVE LESS SLOTS THAN FUCKING BRAZIL, WHAT KIND OF WALTER WHITE LEVEL BLUE METH IS RIOT SNORTING AT THEIR HQ.
                    <br><br>
                    Yes, Brazil has a bigger player base than Korea, and they have a much bigger CS scene than all of fucking Asia. But this a whole new game, and Korea is the fucking Mecca of eSports. For fuck's sake, LoL and Riot Games wouldn't be where they are without Korea, why did Riot give Korea less slots than Brazil.
                    <br><br>
                    Korea's second best team took fnatic to a third map in Iceland, Brazil's best team pulled Yoru out of their ass and boomed out of the tournament. Even several players from NA and EU said in press conferences that Korea deserved another slot at Iceland.
                    <br><br>
                    Final thoughts:
                    <br><br>
                    All of these problems together worry me, I like watching Korean Valorant, It's so different to EU and NA and they're not afraid to play the game the way the want instead of following the western meta. The players are cracked out of their minds and their well thought out, methodical playing style is a blessing to watch.
                    <br><br>
                    But when all of these problems are weighing down this region, I'm afraid that they might slowly crumble and deteriorate over time, where eventually they lose all the potential they have and they become a minor region that sometimes shows a bit of brilliance but never goes on to win any major event.
